celestia is a two-dimensional cartoon space game

you can build satellites and spaceships spacecraft out of parts
spacecraft are represented as a heirarchy of parts, with a special "brain" part at the top.
parts can be structural, propulsion, fuel, and the brain

all spacecraft are persistently simulated and can be permanently destroyed
salvaging parts is big

Structural is grayscale, (0,0,0) is broken and (255,255,255) is durable
Brain is blue circle, (0,0,0) is dead and (0,0,255) is full health
Fuel tanks are green rectangles, (0,0,0) is empty, while (0,255,0) is full
Engines are red triangles, (0,0,0) is throttle cut and (255,0,0) is throttle full

so you start off in space by asteroids

asteroids give you lots of metal and some platinum
comets give you lots of ice and some metal

metal used to make parts - fueltanks, engines, and struts

ice used to make fuel - must be electrolyzed

platinum used to make special parts

red + green is yellow, engines + fuel = industrial parts
red + blue is purple, engines + brain = mechatronic parts
green + blue is cyan, fuel + brain = powerplant parts

industrial parts: (yellow)
- electrolyzer
- refinery (turn metal into platinum + useless slag)

mechatronic parts: (purple)
- detacher
- turntables

powerplant parts: (cyan)
- solar panels
- nukes

as expected some of these parts wouldn't go on your ship
